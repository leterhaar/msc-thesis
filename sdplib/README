SDPLIB 1.2, June 28, 1999.

This is version 1.2 of SDPLIB.  The only change in this version of
SDPLIB is that problem hinf37 has been removed- the problem was
removed because it was identical to problem hinf9.
 
This directory contains the SDPLIB collection of semidefinite
programming test problems.  There are a total of 92 problems in the
collection.  All problems are stored in the SDPA sparse format [5].

The following table describes the problems, and gives optimal objective
values that have been computed by SDPA and cross checked against results
from the problem originators.  Note that in some cases, very slight changes
in the optimal objective function value have occurred as a result of the 
conversion into SDPA format.  Furthermore, different authors have adopted
different conventions for the primal and dual SDP problems.  The results 
reported here are based on the SDPA conventions- thus some objective
function values have their signs changed, and primal or dual infeasibility
means infeasibility with respect to SDPA's primal and dual.
